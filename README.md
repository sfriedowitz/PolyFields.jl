# PolyFields.jl

PolyFields is a minimal Julia implementation of polymer self-consistent field theory,
as described in the extensive monograph
"Fredrickson, G. (2005). The Equilibrium Theory of Inhomogeneous Polymers."
Core implementation details are heavily inspired by the Fortran package [PSCF](https://github.com/dmorse/pscf).

Currently, the package only has the capability of solving the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) equations,
corresponding to a mean-field solution of the underlying field-theoretic partition function.
Implementation of full field-theoretic simultions (FTS) via complex Langevin sampling is a later goal.

## Usage

The PolyFields package is amenable for use in an interactive workspace environment.
The basic structs required for a field-theoretic simulation can be created as follows:

```julia
using PolyFields
```

## TODO

* Add plotting tools for system and field output
* Fix variable cell updater
* Revamp constructors for unit cell class
* GCE performance and stability
